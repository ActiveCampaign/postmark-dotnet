# Postmark
## Leave transactional email delivery to the experts

Postmark helps deliver and track transactional emails for web applications. In a nutshell, the service replaces SMTP (or Sendmail) with a far more reliable, scalable and care-free environment. In addition, you can track statistics for number of emails sent, bounces and spam complaints.

The Postmark.NET NuGet package makes it easier to use the Postmark API from your .NET 2, 3.x, and 4.x projects without having to build your own API calls. You can get your free API token at http://www.postmarkapp.com

### Usage
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/jptoto/postmark-dotnet/wiki) for additional instruction about using the bounce api and additional sending options.
